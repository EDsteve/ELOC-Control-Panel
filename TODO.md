## To-Do:

Start Page
- Map feature: It should zoom to all the ELOC markers automatically - If too complicated. Forget it :)
- "Please update your ELOC Controll Panel app. Your version is not supported any more" - This should show when i choose so in the code (Not a priority and maybe never needed hopefully)

Status page:
- Change all colors to white in the MISC section. No green or red ---> Only if it takes a few clicks for you
- Swipe down refresh problems:
	- It does refresh the SD card but not the recording or other values from the EP32? A manual reconnect refreshes all.
	- refresh only possible after scrolled down first.
- Show possible recording time (calculating from Sample rate and SD space available)

Settings page:
- Under Advanced Options: Current "Device Name" should show in the "Change Device Name" input field
- Add an "Update firmware" button to advanced menu which sends the command #settings#update with a popup saying: Are you sure? etc... Cancel... OK
- Turn ON/OFF bluetooth doesn't work

## General
 - Low priority - // todo: fix view binding issue; Why can't it see the toolbar
 Git test
