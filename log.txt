- fix state of swipe to refresh after json is received
- disable swipe refresh on first load
- poll battery level every 60s
- handle situation where json is received in incomplete chunks
- remove MaterialAlertDialogBuilder and use showModalAlert for a consistent UI experience
- I just remembered thta I had tried to optimize scanning by disabled repeated scans when there are already results in the list. I will revert to always scanning to get fresh results

MISC
- Storage gauge
- Battery gauge
- Grid ID	Riv12
- Uptime	1d 5h 10m

+ App version	ver0.1
